# Project # 19 - Dynamodb Registry Terraform

This Terraform module provisions a multi-environment DynamoDB setup across three data registries, each with a production and staging pair. It implements targeted data models using optimized partition keys, sort keys, and Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) designed for graph, ledger, and analytical access patterns. Utilizing on-demand capacity, the architecture balances cost-efficiency with the ability to handle variable workloads. This automated configuration ensures staging environments accurately reflect production, facilitating reliable testing and secure deployments.

## Tables and Indexes

| Table | PK / SK | GSIs |
|---|---|---|
| NetworkingRegistry (+ `_staging`) | `creator_id` / `user_id` | `GSI_AllKey`, `creator_records_index`, `user_records_index` |
| TransactionRegistry (+ `_staging`) | `user_id` / `timestamp` | `GSI_Payout`, `GSI_order_id` |
| AggregatedDataRegistry (+ `_staging`) | `partition_key` / `sort_key` | `GSI_top_contributor`, `GSI_top_orders`, `GSI_top_tokens` |

**NetworkingRegistry** — models the creator/user follow and subscribe graph. `creator_records_index` lists every user a creator has; `user_records_index` lists every creator a user follows; `GSI_AllKey` provides a full cross-cut for admin tooling.

**TransactionRegistry** — payment ledger. `GSI_Payout` surfaces payout events per creator; `GSI_order_id` looks up a transaction by public order ID.

**AggregatedDataRegistry** — precomputed leaderboard data. Three GSIs rank top contributors, highest-order creators, and highest-token holders for feed ranking and dashboards.

## Architecture

```
Application (Lambda / ECS)
         |
         +---> NetworkingRegistry   (creator_id + user_id, 3 GSIs)
         +---> TransactionRegistry  (user_id + timestamp, 2 GSIs)
         +---> AggregatedDataRegistry (partition_key + sort_key, 3 GSIs)

Each registry has a _staging counterpart for pre-production testing.

## Repository Layout

```
dynamodb-registry-terraform/
├── main-1.tf       # Six aws_dynamodb_table resources with GSIs

## Deployment

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Teardown

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Take a point-in-time backup or export to S3 before destroying. This operation is irreversible.

## Notes

- All tables use `PAY_PER_REQUEST` billing. If traffic patterns stabilise, switching to `PROVISIONED` with autoscaling reduces cost.
- Every write to a base table also writes to all its GSIs. Review GSI usage before adding new indexes.
- `_staging` suffix on table names keeps staging and production isolated within the same AWS account and Terraform apply.
